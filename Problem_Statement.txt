Create api endpoints for a quiz app in Spring boot. Using the apis, a user can do the following:

1. Start new quiz session.
2. Get a random multiple choice question from a set of questions in database
3. Submit answer and
4. Get the total questions answered by user with details on correct and incorrect submission.

There is no need to write other apis to create questions etc. You can use H2 Database for simplicity and seed some questions and a single user. Make any assumptions as you see fit and add those assumptions in your Readme.md file.
